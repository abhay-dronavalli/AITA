AITA - AI Teaching Assistant
An AI-powered teaching assistant that allows teachers to create course-specific tutors in minutes by uploading their materials and selecting subject-area specialized models with configurable educational guardrails.
Project Overview
Problem: Students are using generic AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) that lack course context and often provide answers that defeat the learning purpose.
Solution: AITA creates course-specific AI Teaching Assistants that:

Are grounded in actual course materials (PDFs, lecture recordings)
Follow teacher-configured educational guardrails
Promote learning over direct answers
Use subject-specialized AI models (Math, English, Science)
